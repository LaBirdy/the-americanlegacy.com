        <p>Hello everyone, my name is Lianne, and I'm delighted to introduce myself as the Director of The American Legacy, a vibrant new dance group that cherishes our cultural heritage through the art of movement. With over 20 years of experience in directing dance, my journey began after graduating from BYU with a bachelor's degree in Music Dance Theater, where I honed my passion for artistic expression.

            During my college years, I had the incredible opportunity to perform as a Young Ambassador at BYU, where I shared my love for dance, singing, and acting with audiences from all around the world. It was an unforgettable experience that fueled my passion for the performing arts.

    <section id="about">
       
    <p>Throughout my career, I've been fortunate to be the co-director of the American Rhythm Folk Ensemble, a dynamic group that celebrated the richness of our cultural traditions through dance and music. As time went on, the ensemble grew, and the number of performers became too many for one group to handle.</p>
    <p>
        As a result, The American Legacy was born, splitting from the American Rhythm Folk Ensemble. This new dance group carries forward the same spirit of passion and dedication to preserving our cultural heritage. Now, as the Director of The American Legacy, I'm immensely proud to lead this talented ensemble on a path of creativity and cultural celebration.</p>
        <p>Embracing the spirit of cultural exchange and understanding, we've been honored to participate in several renowned CIOFF Festivals, forging friendships that transcend borders.
            Dance, for me, holds the power to weave stories, bridge divides, and inspire hearts. Through The American Legacy, we endeavor to share the beauty and richness of our diverse heritage, creating memories that last a lifetime. I'm thrilled to embark on this new chapter, continuing our mission of celebrating our roots and connecting with audiences worldwide.</p>
